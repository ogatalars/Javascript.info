function ask(question, yes, no) {
  if (confirm(question)) yes();
  else no();
}

function showOk() {
  alert("You agreed.");
}

function showCancel() {
  alert("You canceled the execution.");
}

// usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask
ask("Do you agree?", showOk, showCancel);

// In practice, such functions are quite useful. The major difference between a real-life ask and the example above is that real-life functions use more complex ways to interact with the user than a simple confirm. In the browser, such functions usually draw a nice-looking question window. But thatâ€™s another story.

// The arguments showOk and showCancel of ask are called callback functions or just callbacks.
