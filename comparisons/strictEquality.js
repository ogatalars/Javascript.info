// // A regular equality check == has a problem. It cannot differentiate 0 from false:

// // alert( 0 == false ); // true
// // The same thing happens with an empty string:

// // alert( '' == false ); // true
// // This happens because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator ==. An empty string, just like false, becomes a zero.

// // What to do if weâ€™d like to differentiate 0 from false?
// A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.

// In other words, if a and b are of different types, then a === b immediately returns false without an attempt to convert them.

console.log(0 === false); // false, because the types are different
