console.log(null === undefined); // false
console.log(null == undefined); // true
// For maths and other comparisons < > <= >=
// null/undefined are converted to numbers: null becomes 0, while undefined becomes NaN.

// Mathematically, that’s strange. The last result states that "null is greater than or equal to zero", so in one of the comparisons above it must be true, but they are both false.

// The reason is that an equality check == and comparisons > < >= <= work differently. Comparisons convert null to a number, treating it as 0. That’s why (3) null >= 0 is true and (1) null > 0 is false.

// On the other hand, the equality check == for undefined and null is defined such that, without any conversions, they equal each other and don’t equal anything else. That’s why (2) null == 0 is false.
