// When a value is passed as a function parameter, it’s also called an argument.

// In other words, to put these terms straight:

// A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function declaration (it’s a declaration time term).
// An argument is the value that is passed to the function when it is called (it’s a call time term).
// We declare functions listing their parameters, then call them passing arguments.

// In the example above, one might say: "the function showMessage is declared with two parameters, then called with two arguments: from and "Hello"".
