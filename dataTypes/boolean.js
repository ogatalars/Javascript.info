// The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

// This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

// For instance:

let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked

let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert(isGreater); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
