// The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.

// The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

// If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:

let age;

alert(age); // shows "undefined"

// let age = 100;

// change the value to undefined
age = undefined;

alert(age); // "undefined"
