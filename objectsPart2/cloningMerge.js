// So, copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object.

// But what if we need to duplicate an object?

// We can create a new object and replicate the structure of the existing one, by iterating over its properties and copying them on the primitive level.

let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

let clone = {}; // the new empty object

// let's copy all user properties into it
for (let key in user) {
  clone[key] = user[key];
}

// now clone is a fully independent object with the same content
clone.name = "Pete"; // changed the data in it

alert(user.name); // still John in the original object
