//The if (…) statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.
// A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false. Because of that they are called “falsy” values.
// Other values become true, so they are called “truthy”.
let cond = year == 2015; // equality evaluates to true or false
