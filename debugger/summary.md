As we can see, there are three main ways to pause a script:

A breakpoint.
The debugger statements.
An error (if dev tools are open and the button is “on”).
When paused, we can debug: examine variables and trace the code to see where the execution goes wrong.

There are many more options in developer tools than covered here. The full manual is at https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools.

The information from this chapter is enough to begin debugging, but later, especially if you do a lot of browser stuff, please go there and look through more advanced capabilities of developer tools.

Oh, and also you can click at various places of dev tools and just see what’s showing up. That’s probably the fastest route to learn dev tools. Don’t forget about the right click and context menus!
